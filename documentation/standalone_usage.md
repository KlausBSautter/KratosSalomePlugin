# Standalone usage for creating MDPA files

This is a brief guide for using some functionalities **INDEPENDENT** of Salome for creating mdpa files that are used as input for Kratos. This is basically what the [salome-kratos-converter](https://github.com/philbucher/salome-kratos-converter#using-the-converter-directly-directly-from-python) did.

Also take a look at ... for more details.

The interface is kept as close to the interface of Kratos as possible.

The [tests]() can also provide some more insights.
